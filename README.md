application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Deployment instructions

## feature ideas
* check box in ingredients view, live update of recipes which contain all of those ingredients
  - this is hard :( might need react or some reactive js
* add "amount:string" column to recipe_ingredient
* add "instructions:text" column to recipe
* meal planner
  - auto schedule for the week, takes from last recently cooked recipe?
* recipe editor
  - instructions
  - ingredients
  - tags
* tags for recipes
  - many to many
* /recipe/:id/make view
  - keeps ingredients on top so they are always visible when scrolling through instructions
